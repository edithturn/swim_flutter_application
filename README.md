[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Some notes:
Folders
- .idea : holds configuration for android studio, don't need to be changed
- android: holds a complete android project, it will merge with the flutter project, no changes needed to be done (rarely).
- build: holds the output of the flutter application, it's generated by the flutter sdk.
- ios: holds a complete xcode project, it will merge with the flutter project.
- lib: 99% of the work, here we will add all our dart files (write code in here)
- test: allows to write automated test.

Files
- pubsec.yaml: to manage dependencies
